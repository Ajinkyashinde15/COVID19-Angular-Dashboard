This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.0.3.

This projec COVID 19 angular dashboard, provides an overview of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 (2019-nCoV) epidemic. The dashboard is built with Angualr 8 using the Highcharts software library for charting written in pure JavaScript.

This project  gather data, make visualizations and perform analysis regarding the COVID-19 epidemic. We saw that data scientists were struggling to share information with each other, so we used this project to aid in the sharing of data and information. This project aims to offer an accessible way for data professionals to share dashboards (that are updated with new data automatically) without requiring any expertise in front end development.

This project been divided into two sections. First is Dashboard, where you can see COVID 19 dashboards for World, India and Maharashtra state with most districts stat. And second section would be COVID 19 forcast, which represents prediction of corona cases for next 14 days. Covid world map is visual represnt of world map and you can hover any country and can see live covid 19 stat data. All application's screenshots and images are listed below.
