This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.0.3.

This project COVID 19 angular dashboard, provides an overview of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 (2019-nCoV) epidemic. The dashboard is built with Angular 8 using the Highcharts software library for charting written in pure JavaScript.

This project gathers data, makes visualizations, and performs analysis regarding the COVID-19 epidemic. We saw that data scientists were struggling to share information with each other, so we used this project to aid in the sharing of data and information. This project aims to offer an accessible way for data professionals to share dashboards (that are updated with new data automatically) without requiring any expertise in front end development.

This project has been divided into two sections. First is Dashboard, where you can see COVID 19 dashboards for World, India and Maharashtra state with most districts stat. And the second section would be the COVID 19 forecast, which represents the prediction of corona cases for the next 14 days. The Covid world map is a visual representation of the world map and you can hover any country and can see live covid 19 stat data.
